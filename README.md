# Wildcard Creator

A simple web editor for creating and managing wildcard files like those used by ComfyUI-Impact-Pack.

## What it does

- Edit YAML wildcard files in your browser
- Visual editor with pattern helpers (don't need to memorize syntax)
- Validation that catches syntax errors, unbalanced braces, and common mistakes
- - **NOTE** - The validation section is in need of more development
- Test your wildcards and see sample outputs
- Dark mode (because your eyes matter)

## How to use

Just open `wildcard-editor.html` in your browser. No server, no install, no fuss.

Import your existing YAML files or start fresh. When you're done, hit export and you're good to go.
